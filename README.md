## Project Title:
Doctor Appointment Application’s Virtual Networking Through Azure
Administration. 

Problem Statement:
In order to facilitate doctor appointment application, the project aims to provide
peering and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between two virtual networks
that are globally located in different regions. 

Project Description:
  This Project includes Various Azure instances and Services, Azure Virtual Networks,
Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Portal, Azure VPN Gateway, Availability Zones,
Windows and Linux images, Storage Account, Translator azure AI Service etc.
  In two different locations, two virtual networks have been created.Subnets were
subsequently established in each virtual network. Then, each subnet has two virtual
machines created in it. A website is Hosted in each Virtual Machine. One gateway
subnet is added to these virtual networks, and two virtual network gateways are then
created in designated areas. Subsequently these virtual networks connected
Bidirectionally with one another and established a VPN tunnel, So that it ensures the
Application’s traffic is private and remains on the Microsoft backbone. It will help in
establishing healthy communication between two different regional networks of this
Application.


Azure Services - 

1. Deployment of Virtual Machines and Hosting a Websites in it

2. V.net to V.net Peering.

3. Virtual Private Network Gateway Connection Bidirectionally.

4. Creation of Storage Account and assigning to specific V.nets

5. Translators in both Regions by Azure Cognitive AI Service.
